The CompressionNeuralNetwork.py is about PIC tech.

The ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py includes the nerual prune tech.

If you want to execute the ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py, you should download SFEW dataset. 
Here I use a subset for SFEW dataset so I need to put the "Subset For Assignment SFEW" folder
in the same directory as ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py
